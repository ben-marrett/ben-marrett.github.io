        <u><h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3></u>
        <p>
          I have learned that maybe I am not quite as good as I thought I was. I thought I’d just roll on in and pick everything up like a piece 
          of cake and plough through it and come out the other end ready and entitled to do/create whatever I want. 
          And while that may be a possibility… I have certainly learned that it will take WORK and an increase of understanding.
          I learned that there is discomfort in digging into this. It is not the easy path. My ego thought it would be and still wants 
          it to be and whenever it is not easy would rather find something else to do.
          Finally I have learned that a lot of my approach in this and life more broadly has been based in competition, seeing others as 
          people to be outdone, as threats, something like that. Like I need to be the best, and others' success 
          is not a part of that. This is probably the saddest thing to come across. But most important in the long run. I'm glad to have 
          another possibility now.
        </p>
        
        <u><h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3></u>
        <p>Values create an anchor… a ‘why?’ for doing things and pushing through difficulties. A reason to get up and get stuck in. A reason to stretch and co-operate, 
          to go beyond what we already know and do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy helps us to see where others are at. Whether it is that they could use some support, are just starting off, or have lots of experience and have a lot to give. Empathy is the key to harmony and everyone getting along,
          whichever stage we are at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness allows change. It is the start point of recognising patterns and habits. In a programming perspective it can 
          permit us to ask for help, try something, do further research etc. Basically to find out and do whatever is needed to solve a 
          problem or complete a task. And I guess that goes for life too. Without self-awareness we have no control over how we interact 
          with the world and our experiences. We become passengers rather than drivers.
        </p>
        <u><h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3></u>
        <p>
          Basically just how big the area is… like the limits are non-existent. Who has achieved perfection? I don’t know but from what 
          I see and feel we all have further growth and lessons. I am surprised at the task we are taking on when we set out to improve 
          ourselves and our groups. It is pretty amazing and so unique.
        </p>
        <u><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3></u>

        <p>
          Narrowing down some identity and values was challenging. Even now I still have some big questions. It’s easy to take on 
          other peoples ideas of what is great, but getting clear on what is important to me still remains an exploration. 
          Introducing myself and putting words out there was a challenge. Fear of judgment, rejection, ridicule.

        </p>
        <u><h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web 
          development bootcamp course?</h3></u>
        <p>
          To show that there is something deeper and more important than technological progress for the sake of progress. Recognising 
          the reality that we all share space and interact, and that can be pleasant or not so good. Working on making it even better. 
          Great projects can arise from a good team of emotionaly intelligent, caring and dedicated people… with a strength 
          and unity that wouldn’t exist otherwise. <br>
          Core work also helps individuals to get out of their shells. To expand and become better versions of themselves. 
          To reach places they may otherwise never reach.Setting people up with the skills that will allow them to move forward beyond the 
          time spent on bootcamp.
        </p>
        <u><h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise 
          programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3></u>
        <p>
          Not at all. It is vital and a refreshing breath in amongst all of the difficult programming tech. It keeps another part of the 
          mind active. Justified by my feeling that without it there would probably be much more tendency to give up and quit. Without 
          simultaneously working on what comes up in the core areas, our programming would be less likely to be able to continue growing. 
          There would be blocks that may not be overcome. This is a long journey and it is important to build the skills that will 
          provide stamina, resilience and patience to keep learning on into the future.
