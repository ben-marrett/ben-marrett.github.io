        <u><h3>Neuroplasticity</h3></u>

      <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn and develop new things and literally build new 
        connections. When people are aware of this ability, possibilities open up and people begin to believe
        that they can change, and that they are not stuck with specific abilities and destined to stay the same 
        forever more.
      </p>
        <p>For me, just knowing about this concept is enough to give a boost in confidence and renewed appreciation for this journey 
          and what could be possible.
          It sounds like we are in a generation that is really entering new territory as far as these understandings go, and that has 
          to be an honour and a privilege in itself.
          So I could engage with these principals by getting very clear on any areas that I’d really like to make change in. Using my 
          wildest imagination. Taking some time to contemplate this, and start to play around with the power of thought and imagination. 
          How far can we take this?
          </p>
        <p>
          In present time, to get started with a small practical example - I have always considered myself a night owl. It’s just in my nature! 
          I <em>must</em> stay up late, and every now and then go all out and stay up until like 3am.
        </p>
          <br>
        <p></p>
          OK. So with neuroplasticity and the awareness that deep down I would like to be more consistent with early morning starts for my learning journey, 
          I could see what is possible here. Start small and imagine myself getting up early… before my family…
          peace and quiet… nice. I notice that the pattern really starts the night before, so it is going to mean going to bed earlier too. 
          Give myself a bedtime. Say 11pm.
          That’s….hard…. to imagine.
          Time to engage with the principals.</p>

        <p>
            Essentially the principles amount to taking captaincy of your own ship and acknowledging that 
            the way to change the brain is by using it in new ways. We have to remodel it by changing what 
            we see as important and what constitutes success. This is a work in progress and we can save what 
            works along the way.
            
            Each brain is ONE OF A KIND - the most complicated instrument on the planet.
            Learning new skills allows the brain to create new areas of specialization. With this comes further support 
            within the networks.
        </p>

<p>
    I enjoyed this article, which offered <a href link="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain#takeaway">a light perespective on ways
    to engage with neuroplasticity.
    </a href>
    <br>
    Ideas included:
    <ul>
    <li>Play video games! (wow, keen…)
    e.g. puzzles, adventure, rhythm</li>
        <li>Learn a new language</li>
            <li>Make music</li>
                <li>Travel - new scenery and surroundings</li>
                    <li>Exercise</li>
                        <li>Make art! (unfocusing)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p> I also listened to a talk with Andrew Huberman who spoke about increasing the potentials of neuroplasticity even more by using pharmacology. Certain substances 
    may help create new levels of focus and optimum skill-learning states. He also touched on the importance of being willing to let go of linearities. 
    To toggle between the states of art and science. Fascinating!
</p>
<h3><u>Growth Mindset</u></h3>
<p>Growth mindset is embracing that change really is possible. It is accepting where I am at now, while recognising that there is a path 
    toward anything I wish to create, develop or achieve. It is relevant because we have all generally had years of conditioning by 
    ourselves and those around us. We tend to think of ourselves a certain way and that we are good at this, bad at that, and thats just 
    who we are. The amazing thing about growth mindset is that it blows all of this away and says that if there’s something we’d like to do… 
    we can work on it! 
</p>
<p>What changed for me in this exploration was just getting a better grasp on how far this could be applied. I’ve heard it before many times and thought… 
    "aw yeah, that’s cool. Sounds good." <br>

    Now I’m taking it more as an invitation… maybe even a challenge… how far can you go? What can you change? What can you achieve? 
    How good can you become?
</p>
<p>I will integrate this by getting honest about where I’m at and where I’d like to be and really seeing the difference between the two. 
    What will need to happen?
    This opens up skills that will need to be developed and practiced.
    Then the rest is up to me… am I willing to take this on? Am I willing to work at it?
    If so, I can achieve my goal.
    If not, probably more of the same or maybe a slight improvement.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoyed the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">talk by Carol Dewick</a> and particularly what was possible with the schools going from bottom of the pile to top. That’s pretty big!!

<ul><li>Not yet - The power of "yet."</li>
    
    <li>Embrace Error. Learn from it and correct it. </li>
    
    <li>Abilities can be developed.</li>
</ul>
    
    Is my biggest goal just passing the test? Just making it through the course? Or is it to really learn and develop my abilities and get to where I want to be? To know new things and be able to create and contribute?
    
    Can I use praise wisely?
     Reward myself for engaging in the process, and not backing away. Keep positive if I am doing this and recognise if I am backing away.
    Push out of comfort zone.
    Transform meaning of effort and difficulty. Make new connections. Get smarter.
    
    More effort.
    Let’s not waste our lives.
</p>
<h3><u>Blending findings with Learning Plan</u></h3>
<p>
    Well, these understandings bring me to a decision point… do I mean what I say when I write that I’d like to work with an awesome global 
    company working on cutting edge software? Cause that’s a pretty huge goal, and there is a big gap between where I am now and what it 
    would take to be there.<br>
Maybe it makes it clearer what steps would have to happen in the interim.<br>
Maybe it encourages me to get more specific. What exactly is the area I’d like to work in. <Br>
This then would open up clearer channels perhaps, from where I am at. <br>
It forces me to get more specific and not just cruise along convincing myself that I am on track when really I’m in 
“fake it til you make it” mode. I can revisit my strengths and limitations and see where I’m at there. This is an area of potential growth.
I notice from the outset that I can be quite dreamy in my writing. It’s easy to talk the talk. Now I could focus more on practical steps 
with technical aspects and stop relying on elaborate stories that distract.
</p>
<P>Limitations- time management. This I could improve and is linked with what I said about changing my sleeping habits.
<br>
Also bringing in the human skills. This would be an area I could use some imagination and work on what exactly these skills are that are 
going to make a difference in the long run.
I can narrow in on what makes a co-operative team.<br>
What is good communication. What changes do I need to make there?<Br>
How can I be more open to feedback?<br>
<br>
Am I out to prove myself?<br>
Do I doubt myself?<Br>
Why am I doing this?<Br>
<br>

<br>
<em>“...always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you’re secretly worried it’s a pair of tens”</em>
<br>
Relate to that!<br>
From here I am interested in moving in the direction of the passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval.
