    <h2><u>Classes vs. ID's - best practices.</u></h2>
    </header>
    <div class="blog-entry">
    <p> There are times and places where either class or ID could be used as a selector to style our content, and knowing which is the more appropriate option in any given scenario
        can make all the difference for reasons of organization, readability and developer collaboration.

        <h3><em>A wee analogy.</em></h3>
        <p>One way I have come to think of classes and ID's is a simple comparison with my own young family at home. Our children all each have a unique ID, a collection
        of individual attributes that make up each child. Fingerprint, appearance, personal characteristics etc.
        On the other hand, our children also go to a school, where there are certain rules that apply to everyone who attends, irrespective of what their name is or
        where they come from or some other unique personal factor. This CLASS may create rules such as: everyone within this room is between
        the age of 9 & 10, or, everyone in this class will wear this navy blue uniform, or, everyone in this class will do mathematics at 10am on
        a Tuesday.<br>
          So, for me this presents a simple way of looking at how to use Class and ID. If there is a particular part of a website that I may want to
        narrow in on and make specific changes to in a way unlike any other, then I would use the ID. This may be the equivalent of picking out a student
        in the school whom I would like to offer some unique opportunity to, perhaps because they show a proficiency in music for example. I can pick the ID
        of this student and add in this special curriculum element for them that doesn't affect any of the other students in the school.
        Same thing on a home level -  we can select a child and decide "this kid needs a haircut!", and make this change to one particular child, where it
        would really not be appropriate to go and insist that the entire school class should have a short back and sides.
        <br>
        On the class level we may decide "Hey, let's get everyone a new uniform", and then it is appropriate to apply the rule to everyone, that from then on
        every student in the class will arrive with a red uniform. Or, everyone in the class will now do gardening at 10am on Tuesdays instead of 
        mathematics.
        <br>
        (I don't know that treating kids like elements to be controlled and shaped is ideal but initially it made sense!)
    </p>
    <h3><b>Best practices.</b></h3>
    Some best practices within the use of these two selectors, include:
        <ul>
            <li><u><b>Name semantically. Don't be too vague.</b></u><br>
                    Describe the context of the element rather than just the position on screen or what it looks like.
                    The name could answer - what is it? what does it do? why is it here?</li>
                    <br>
            <li><u><b>...but don't be too specific either.</b></u><br>
                    For example, if we name a Class with a specific color and later change the color, then we will be going
                    back to the html to change this color title in the class otherwise it will be named confusingly from then
                    on.</li>
                    <br>
            <li><u><b>Align with other websites.</b></u><br>
                    What are other developers naming similar elements?</li>
                    <br>
            <li><u><b>Is being able to link directly to a certain section on a page important?</b></u><br>
                    If so, ID's are unique in allowing us to do this.</li>
                    <br>
            <li><u><b>Is there more than one element that requires this same styling, now or in future?</b></u><br>
                    If this is even a possibility, Class is probably the desired option.</li>
                    <br>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Some examples.</b></h3>
    <p> So, going back to our analogy, to me ID links up nicely with the uniqueness of any given child.
        On a website, this might be like... one specific section that branches off a main article (eg. Wikipedia).
        So if the wikipedia article was on my family, and I wanted to have a section on my son Noah, then I would give that section an ID
        like "NoahHartBio", and this would be safe as I am pretty certain that there will not be any other Noahs on the same page at this point or any time soon.
<br>
        If however I wanted to make a change to a more generic part of a website where there are multiple occurences then I would use CLASS.
        This might look something like this:
