      <u><h3>The difference between HTML, CSS & JavaScript.</h3></u>

        <p>HTML brings the basic elements of the page into existence, and their general positioning within the whole.
        Imagine we are designing a universe. There’s Earth… It is made up rock, water, plants, animals etc. It has a certain distance from another element 
        called the Sun, which is at the centre of Earth and a scattering of other planets. There’s a moon over there, a wee distance away from Earth. And 
        there’s this other planet we’ll call Saturn, we’ll give that atleast 53 moons. Sweet. Sprinkle in a heap of asteroids, comets, and dust and we’re 
        just about done with this particular solar system. Which is sitting alongside a billion others inside a Galaxy. Which is among billions of other 
        galaxies in the Universe!</p>

        <p>From there, CSS gets in to a bit more detail and starts to style things up. We might put a general theme on all of these different planets. Let’s 
        make them all spherical. Ok. Now, let’s get creative on Earth… bit of green, lot’s of blue. This Sun over here, let’s make that blazing hot and 
        bright orange. That planet over there? Pure gas, none of that rocky stuff.</p>

        <p>Javascript brings us into the nitty gritty of how all of this is going to move and interact. When the suns heat reaches a 
        certain point, the Water over here on Earth is going to evaporate at this rate and create these fluffy white clouds in the sky. Later these 
        clouds will dump all of this new found water over the farmland on the other side of the planet, where the people and animals will rejoice and the 
        pumpkins will grow enormous. Also let’s start these asteroids off travelling at a zippy wee speed of 25 kilometres per second. Yeah that sounds 
        cool. Make sure they’re somewhat random and could crash into anything in their path. Wipe things out now and then. Awesome. Alright I suppose we 
        could make Earth’s atmosphere decent enough to disintegrate most of said space rocks. Peace!</p>



        <u><h3>Back on Earth... control flows & loops.</h3></u>

        <p>Generally we like things to go smoothly. We have a start and an end. This is the starting point for control flow, where JavaScript basically by 
        default will start at the top and run through each line down to the bottom where it will end. However, not everything acts in a strictly linear 
        sense. Sometimes we take a step back, repeat steps, or stop off somewhere to check things out.
        An example might start off with ‘Human-being A’ sitting on their couch, with headphones on, listening to some music. Things are humming along 
        nicely, reasonably pleasant tunes playing, while Human A just sits and thinks about the universe. Suddenly a particular tune begins with a roar 
        and a bang, and Human A feels a jolt of electricity run through their spine, their eyes open a little wider and their head begins to nod in 
        rhythm. Bumbling along nicely is no longer an option. Human A gets to their feet, hits the |< button and starts the tune again from the opening 
        chord. This time when the beat unfolds, human A proceeds to wave arms around, shake sporadically and move feet in a weird kind of way. Human A 
        enjoys this tune and at the end decides to click on their device, add to playlist. Nice. Back to the couch. The next song is a bit of a downer 
        and instantly frustrates Human A and has them quickly hit >| skip button. And again, and again, and again. None of these tunes are quite matching 
        the dance worthiness of that last one. Another semi-decent tune comes on and human A decides this is a good one to nod head and think about the 
        universe again. Aye… Time to get up and go to work. Song selection loop ends, perhaps to be entered again another time.
        </p>

        <p>A program can run various loops in this kind of interactive format where certain things can be called to happen if conditions are met, or while 
        something is true or false, etc.
        </p>


        <u><h3>The DOM</h3></u>
        <p>The DOM is an interface that allows us to look at and interact with all aspects of a webpage, and allows the manipulation of the document’s 
        HTML and CSS using a scripting language like JavaScript. The Document Object Model is the glue that ties it all together and is what allows the 
        content to be accessed and manipulated.
        </p> <br>

        <p>So, stepping back into our original analogy, the DOM is the means that allows us for example to grab hold of one of the Planets in our solar 
        system, ok let’s grab Earth, and decide “hey, you need another moon!” So within the DOM we are manipulating the whole document(universe?) and 
        indeed this small part of it by adding content that was not there before. We can also alter the content of this element(Earth), by say… removing 
        the gravity, so that suddenly that extra moon we added is floating away into the ether alongside it’s new companion and the people of Earth are now 
        also all beginning to float into the sky!! AHHH.</p>
        Is DOM manipulation like playing God on a webpage? Perhaps so. With great power comes great responsibility! Maybe keep the gravity.

        
        <h3><u>Arrays and Objects</u></h3>
        <p>Arrays are a sequence of values held in [square, brackets, like, this]. Each value within the array is related to once specific variable, and 
        is indexed, i.e takes a numbered position, starting from 0 on the left and progressing upwards 1, 2, 3 and so on as values are added in sequence. 
        Utilising the index number is how data is accessed from the array. 
        Items can be added and removed from the beginning or end of an array using the push(), pop(), unshift(), and shift() methods.
        </p>

        <p>Objects are able to hold collections of different properties all related to a specific object. The main difference here is that to access this 
        information we will need to know more than just a number in a sequence. We access it by declaring what part of the object we are going to look 
        at, change, or make use of. Maybe it’s an address, or a number, or a name, or some other attribute that has been stored among all the data about 
        the specific thing. This attribute is accessed, added, changed or removed by using either dot or bracket notation.
        </p>
        
        <h3><u>Functions.</u></h3>
        <p>Functions are aspects of the program that perform a particular task, depending on what procedure they have been programmed to undertake. 
        The function takes some input, executes it’s code and then gives the appropriate output. Once a function has been defined, it can be called up 
        as often as required in multiple places whenever the same task is required. And can also use the same code with different arguments to produce 
        different results. These are invaluable pieces of code that can allow for a lot of dynamic activity on the page.
