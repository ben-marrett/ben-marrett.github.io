    <h2>Core Values</h2>
Personal Responsibility.
Increasing personal responsibility is important to me at this point in time. What this means is ever-changing, but at present seems to involve taking ownership for what I am thinking, feeling, saying and doing.
It is important to me to be continuously growing and working towards more genuine connection and care, which can then allow for real change in my life, family, community and out into the world. It is easy to read and speak of this but the real value is in putting it into practice and bringing new possibilities to life. This is not always comfortable or by any means the easier path, but always results in a more peaceful state for myself and those around me. We are connected creatures, more than we generally acknowledge, and ignoring this surely contributes to much of the world’s strife and suffering.

Over the past 4 or 5 years I have really dug in and done my best work to move out of some patterns that were no longer serving me or my family. I had some unwise habits and It was imperative that I make a decision. Was I to continue on this path and keep avoiding reality and causing suffering or do something difficult and bring it all up ready to make a change. I opted to get very honest with this, for the sake of my children, family, everyone else in the world and also myself. Knowing that my actions were undoubtedly having an impact on the futures of my young children was the piece that made it a no-brainer. Ultimately it has led to enormous increase in respect within my family, greater peace and communication, love, safety, and room to explore new goals and directions.

If something is not working it is on me to make a change. If I am bumping into things along the way there are lessons I can learn. I feel that as a result I do not get too attached to any particular way of thinking or doing and remain flexible in mind and deeds. Do something as long as it is appropriate, and when it is no longer then do something else.

I value going deep and gaining full understanding, not just skimming the surface. For me this means having a firm grounding and confidence in my ability. It is important not to only take things at face value but to get interested and take another look from different angles. This also means always being willing to change my beliefs and ideas on any given area. Flexibility is a core value of mine and is mirrored in the physical realm where I love to keep moving and participate in all sorts of outdoor activity.

My culture reminds me to remain humble and kind. Often there can be potential for getting carried away in egotistical fancies, especially with experiences of success and progress. However I would say my culture continuously provides opportunities to reflect on this and remember that as long as we stand on this Earth we have more work to do and there is also probably someone else who’s suffering we could be helping to alleviate in one way or another. Gratitude helps bridge this gap, remaining grateful for what we have and not taking things for granted. Realistically success has been built not just by any one individual but with the support, guidance and previous efforts of many who have come before.

Strengths and limitations.
My strengths seem to include a strong moral imperative. If something does not feel right I will act accordingly, and try and discover and do what is right and needed even if it means going against the crowd or applying extra effort.
I tend to support the best version of people and not really buy into complaints and excuses. I know we are all capable of contributing something good to the world, and so I don’t see much value in entertaining fixed ideas that manifest lesser outcomes or allow people to rest on their laurels.

I am very open to feedback from people I trust when I know that they are coming from a caring place. It pays to discover where I might have a blindspot, and give thanks for the opportunity to see things from a new perspective.

A limitation might be that I can tend to hold back and not fully commit myself in some areas. I might have an idea but just sit back and let everything unfold when I could be helping out and giving more to the creation.
I also can perhaps overthink things and let things stew for longer than is helpful. Thrashing things out and determined to get to the correct decision. I like things to be well thought-out so that can be a strength but just sometimes steps over into taking TOO LONG. This mode can lead to stress and swimming around in confusion. Generally I do get out of it eventually though!
When I do get stuck in my mind I can become hot-headed and drop my overall kind and caring demeanour. That’s something I continue to work on, to remain more predictable.

Strengths are my willingness to put in the work and nut things out. I find I can grasp things quite well and like to get a deep understanding of how things work. I feel this could support me well on this particular learning journey as I will enjoy getting into the nitty gritty of what’s going on.
Also my willingness to persevere and keep looking for a solution. I don’t give up when I know there is a particular goal in mind.

Limitations - tendency to be quite slow and relaxed. I don’t know how this is going to work in the intense bootcamp environment. I am going to have to really hunker down with new habits of sticking to schedule and not just doing things whenever I am ready too. I think a strength that will help me here is my commitment to serving my team and when it comes to working in pairs and group I have no intention of holding things up or letting people down.

Sometimes I get a wee bit grumpy and hot-headed - I will need to work on applying compassion and consideration for others when it comes to working together.
I also recently started to see a tendency to talk the talk and not always necessarily walk the walk. This will affect my learning and career development if I am making promises or spouting ideas and not backing them up with action and heart. I will need to be mindful of what I choose to commit to and hold myself accountable to follow through to completion. To ignore this would lead to lack of trust and rapport and ultimately stifle opportunities in the future.

I have had an example of tension when I have held a different belief to others regarding topical matters where they were prioritising science and I was more interested in the philosophy and maybe psychology of the area being explored. My strategy was to quieten down and not get into too heated a debate. In hindsight I do not think this is overly helpful always, as there may have been an opportunity for us all to learn together and iron out some of the barriers of understanding. I now think some decent exploration is a worthwhile strategy to pursue as either I, the other, or both of us have the possibility of coming away from the interaction with an expanded mind and more compassionate understanding. So I would try and put my feelings and thoughts into clear language that communicates my point of view well, and keep clearing it up until it is understood, instead of just shying away and not sharing what I can offer. This requires valuing my own perspective enough to do the mahi required to get it out there.
