        <h3><u>What is Emotional Intelligence?</u></h3>
	    A measure of a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions.

        <h3><u>How is it different to IQ?</u></h3>
	    <p>IQ is an Intelligence Quotient, a number derived from a standardised intelligence test. Abilities like visual/spatial processing, general 
            world knowledge, reasoning and memory are measured and compared with other people in the same age group.
	        EQ is more about identifying emotions, being in tune with how other people are feeling, being able to control one’s own emotional state, 
            utilising these abilities to communicate well and be able to relate to others.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Why is it important?</u></h3>
	    <p>Emotional intelligence can lead us toward a fulfilled and happy life where we are connected to others and able to work together in teams, 
            deal with change, manage stress and efficiently turn intention to action. High EQ correlates with strong leadership potential and overall 
            success. Trust is important to people, and dealing with someone who shows decent EQ is likely to lead to an increase in trust through the 
            positive behaviour being shown.
