        <u><h3>Houston...</h3></u>

      <p>
        I bumped into a few things all at once during this sprint. Something of a snowball effect!
        It all piled on at the section on 'Built-In Methods'. This was a challenge where we were tasked with
        making use of functions which are already written within the JavaScript library and are available to use, 
        although as our intro did state, "you just need to know how to use it!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The problems probably started with the realisation that the research was on me. Some initial documents were given as a starting
        point but really I was gonna have to put in some mahi to bring it all together and make things work.<br>
        So, here I am with only the bare bones of a function in front of me and a need to work out how to write code 
        that will pass certain tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realisticially these problems were reasonably simple. Challenging but doable. Yet my initial approach to even looking for ways to 
        go about solving them was inappropriately serious, convoluted and resulted in more confusion. My own attitude had me lost and
        ready to give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was scouring the internet and finding many different potential ways of writing the same thing. Some ways that were overly advanced for the task at hand, 
        some that were too simple and not up to the task. I think it was this lack of clarity on exactly what I was steering toward that contributed to the 
        solidifying of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>In essence, the problem was to have the function able to look within an object and locate a name and the door number associated with that name. However I 
        had taken the story and dramatized it... Suddenly the code is a game of hide and seek and I've got to find Scooby Doo and how I am supposed to do that 
        and all of a sudden I am caught up in the mystery and in desperate need of help!
      </p>
      <p>
        Time to get a bit more precise on my googling. So, how <em>do</em> I use a function to search within an array and locate a certain parameter? Rechecking the 
        instructions I see it is to use the built-in method "find". OK.
        Still, the things I tried out seemed to have me running in circles and not really achieving what is needed. One step forward, two steps back. 
        I checked in on Slack where I could see that someone else had similar troubles on this exercise and there was a bit of guidance there but I was still 
        confused. I had got to a point where I was reasonably confident that I was using "find" to succesfully locate Scooby, but just wasn't quite getting the 
        return in the console that I wanted. <br>
        Why was it still coming back undefined?
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, I felt I had googled, sought peer help, console logged, tried various things and paid heed to the error messages. Reality is there was a 
        sample solution sitting in the file staring at me so I decided to put it to use. I was frustrated and just wanted to know. Feels a bit cheaty, however, 
        when I did take a look things began to make much more sense. I think 'undefined' was returning as I had pushed forward and neglected what would happen 
        in the very first two instances of test where the array was empty. I had skipped steps. If I had really used pseudocode here perhaps this wouldn't have 
        happened.<br>
        Valuable lessons learnt and further understanding gained on problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Admittedly it doesn't feel all that great for me to make use of sample solutions and I really equate it with failure and cheating.
        My only reconciliation is that this is KATA, and these are designed to be repeated over and over. Meaning perhaps now I can try it again with a new approach 
        and not need to take a peek at the solution. I am happy to have learnt more about functions and built-in methods throughout all the struggles.

      <h3><u>Problem Solving Techniques and Processes</u></h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I realise that I did not fully have a grasp of the value of <b>pseudocode</b> through this sprint. I was using it vaguely and not in a useful manner. 
        Now I begin to see how useful and appropriate it can be in saving time and frustration, particularly coding for tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trying things out</b> is fine but can lead to increasesd frustration if results do not come.</li>
          <li>
            I love the <b>rubber ducky method</b> and feel confident in using it. It's surprisingly insightful!</li>
          <li>
            <b>Error messages</b> are invaluable and oft times provide subtle hints at simple mistakes and easy solutions.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Console.logging</b> has become a more prevalent tool for me and I will continue to use it further.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Googling</b> is fine... can continue to refine search and narrow in on exactly what is needed. Tune out the noise.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Asking peers for help</b> - I am not confident in this as evidenced by looking where others have asked for help and kind of equating that as me asking for help. 
        I don't really think they are the same thing. Can overcome this.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am ok <b>asking coach for help</b> when really stuck.</li>
          <li><b>Reflection</b> is great and helps see all from a wider perspective of what's really going on.
          </li>
        </ul>

      Thank you.
