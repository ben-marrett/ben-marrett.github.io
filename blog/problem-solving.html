        <u><h3>Houston...</h3></u>

      <p>
        Bumped into a few things all at once during this sprint.
        It all really piled on at the section on 'Built-In Methods'. This was a challenge where we were tasked with
        making use of functions which are already written within the JavaScript library and available to use. 
        As our intro did state, <em>"you just need to know how to use it!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problems probably started with the realisation that for this challenge, the responsibility of research was upto me. Some initial documents were given 
        as a starting point, but really I was gonna have to put in the work to find what was needed and bring it all together.<br>
        So, here I am with only the bare bones of a function in front of me, needing to work out how to write code 
        that will pass certain tests. My initial attitude toward looking for ways to go about solving these tasks was 
        pretty serious, and laden with panic. So from the get go I was really building stress and confusion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Scouring the internet led to finding many different potential ways of writing the same thing. Some ways that were overly advanced for the task at hand, 
        some that were too simple and insufficient. I think it was the lack of clarity on exactly what I was aiming for that contributed to
        solidifying the problem.
      </p>
      <p>In essence, the problem was to have the function look within an object and locate a name and the door number associated with that name. However I 
        had taken the story and dramatized it... Suddenly the code is a complicated game of hide and seek and I've got to find Scooby Doo... 
         and how I am supposed to do that!? and all of a sudden I am caught up in the mystery and in desperate need of help!
      </p>
      <p>
        Widening back I could eventually see that it was time to get a bit more precise on my googling. 
        So, how <em>do</em> I use a function to search within 
        an array and locate a certain parameter? Rechecking the instructions I could see it was to use the built-in method "find". OK. That's a good start.
        </p>
        <p> 
        I had got to a point where I was reasonably confident that I was using "find" to succesfully locate Scooby, but just wasn't quite getting the 
        return in the console that I wanted. <br>
        Why was it still coming back with an error about undefined?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is when another look at the error message gave a vital key.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of just seeing a big red "NO, WRONG!" sign, something clicked.
        One of the initial tests involved giving the function an empty array, and I realised this is where the 'undefined' was coming from.
        I had deleted what had allowed me to pass the initial 2 tests of the exercise to make way for my new code, instead of building on that code. So the solution 
        was to bring back into the code what should happen if the array is empty. This one piece allowed everything to flow nicely.<br>
        Valuable lessons learnt and further understanding gained on problem solving.
      </p>

      <h3><u>A bit more elegant.</u></h3>
      <p>
        A time that I solved something a bit more elegantly is when working on a task called FizzBuzz. For this one I had everything working nicely until one 
        point where I converted all inputs into lower case so that I could find the word "buzz" regardless of how it was put in eg. "BuZZ/buzZ/BUZZ". 
        The trouble here was that by doing this I had affected a previous test where some words like "Hello" needed to start with a capital and were now lower case 
        along with all the buzzes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sorted this quite quickly by adjusting the code to only temporarily put an element into lower case and check if it was equal to "buzz", and from there it
        would remove this word and everything else would be unaffected by the lower case change. I was pretty chuffed with this one.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Problem Solving Techniques and Processes</u></h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I realise that I did not fully have a grasp of the value of <b>pseudocode</b> through this sprint. I was using it vaguely and not in a useful manner. 
        Now I begin to see how useful and appropriate it can be in saving time and frustration, particularly coding for tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trying things out</b> is fine but for me can lead to increasesd frustration if results do not come.</li>
          <li>
            I love the <b>rubber ducky method</b> and feel confident in using it. It's surprisingly insightful!</li>
          <li>
            <b>Error messages</b> are invaluable and oft times provide subtle hints at simple mistakes and easy solutions.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Console.logging</b> is something I will aim to use much more productively.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Googling</b> is fine... can continue to refine search and narrow in on exactly what is needed. Tune out the noise.</li>
          <li>
          <b>Asking peers for help</b> - I have not been overly confident in this and tend to look to Slack in the hope that others have asked for help. I am sure 
          the following sprint may offer an opportunity to remedy this.
          </li>
          <li>
            I am ok <b>asking coach for help</b> when really stuck.</li>
          <li><b>Reflection</b> is great and helps see all from a wider perspective of what's really going on.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      Thank you.
