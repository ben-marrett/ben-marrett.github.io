<h2>Update - Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

<h3><u>Long Term Goal // Career Pathway</u></h3>
<p>
  My aim after leaving bootcamp is to get straight to work. I would like to be confident enough by then to be immersed in networking, 
  and starting to reach out to places for a role. <br>
	Long term I would like to be working on global projects, fully applying our core work and contributing care and kindness for 
  humanity into products that are used by many people. <br>
	Eventually I’d love to be able to travel far and wide and pick up roles across the globe, working remotely sometimes along 
  the way. But always part of an awesome team. <Br>
	And I think that is the crux of my goal and pathway. To be part of a great crew/s, playing my part, and constantly evolving.
</p>

<h3><u>Strengths and Limitations</u></h3>

<p>
  My idea of my strengths and limitations has changed in recent weeks.
	I was previously seeing my relaxed nature as detrimental and something that didn’t match the high pace of learning and movement, 
  where as now I see that perhaps it could be helpful in dealing with the challenges, doing my best in any given moment and making it 
  through the storm!

	I see that sometimes I still have trouble wrapping my head around complicated things and being able to come up with solutions. This will 
  hinder me if I drop the growth mindset. If I adopt any attitude that I am not good enough then I am not going to feel too flash about 
  what I can contribute in any pair or group situation.

	I also had a bit of a shift in seeing that I was talking a big talk, with grand visions and verbose paragraphs, but when it comes to 
  backing it up with action I have not always been so willing. This disparity is unhelpful and I will aim to really make up my mind and 
  keep grounded on what I am aiming to achieve.
</p>

<h3><u>Non-technical challenge</u></h3>

<p>
  I reckon just maintaining the self-belief required to keep going and see it through. It will be a test to keep going and not give up when 
  things get tough. When others in the group might seem to be firing on all cylinders and loving it and creating awesome stuff 
  and I’m like… “what on earth is happening!?”
	<br>So yeah I think it’s a thing of where I fit in a group. Knowing my place and what I can offer, what is OK that I can’t offer, 
  and everything in between. Group dynamics and not thinking we all need to be the same.

</p>

<h3><u>Non-technical skills to develop</u></h3>

<p>
  I would like to develop a humble confidence in myself, what I value and stand for, so that I am comfortable sharing and giving to others 
  whatever I can in a helpful way. This would open up more of a leadership and co-operative mindset, where I have had a tendency to take a 
  back-seat approach up until now and just go along with things.
	Also feeling I would like to establish a diligence that I have been lacking. I aim to improve my willingness to show up and put in the 
  necessary effort each and every day, and build on the skills required for really being dependable in a team.

</p>

<h3><u>Expectations of Bootcamp team</u></h3>

<p>
  I’m thinking gentle reminders from the bigger picture perspective. Like if I’m lost in something that is really not 
	the be-all-end-all, or as big and defeating as I’m making out, perhaps a reminder of this and a nudge to get back on track with what 
  is under my control.<br>
	Admittedly I’m not sure what should be expected of the team and what is fully my responsibility, it’s an interesting area as I don’t 
  think dependency would be ideal.<br>
	From that, maybe the optimum support would be in ensuring that technical understanding is landing and things are 
	really making sense to an appropriate level. That the pieces are coming together for what might be required in an entry 
	position at a company and if not, then why is that.
</p>

<h3><u>Expectations of Self</u></h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I will start each week with reflection on where I'm at and what the week ahead is looking like.</li>
    <li>What needs addressed? What the goal is? What challenges might come up? etc.</li>
    <li>I will make use of lists to establish what needs to be done weekly/daily.</li>
    <li>I will show up every day on time.</li>
    <li>I will take care of my mental, physical and spiritual health by continuing to make time for yoga, exercise, and using 
      tools to maintain perspective and stay responsible and caring for others. </li>
    <li>Will continue making use of toggl tracker, and other timers for time blocking.</li>
    <li>I will also try out distraction-blocking apps to cut out social media that interferes.</li>
    <li>I will seek support a little sooner than I did through Foundations, to keep things moving. This would likely be contacting
      facilitators through discord/slack etc. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Foundations Learning Plan 14 Feb 2022</h2>
<h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

<p>Long, long term I would love to work with a company doing software development on something big and intertwined with human
consciousness on a global level… maybe something in a metaverse-type realm or a project like Neuralink. Maybe something in blockchain, 
social media, or in a rocket lab. I don’t know but something big, juicy and interesting.
On the way to this I would love to start as a junior developer and learn the ropes with a beautiful company here in New Zealand.
I don’t mind too much what work this would be other than that it presents an opportunity for growth, is a positive contribution to society
and involves an aligned team enjoying working together on the project. 
</p>

<h3><u>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3></u>

<p>Some strengths include vision. I am quite fond of deep contemplation about what is going on in my own life and in the wider world, 
    and as a result I feel that my interest in the learning journey is quite multidimensional. I know how far the ripples spread and 
    that we are capable of great things as a society if we all work together. What we choose to place our attention on and how we proceed 
    really does make a difference, and so I will continue to aim high and take on the challenges along the way. I do not take life for granted. 
    I think my commitment to bigger picture values could be a strength as it prevents me from giving up.

Limitations - My time management is not exactly marvellous, and will definitely need improvement. I am coming out of several years of my life 
where I have worked part-time and spent the rest of my time hanging out and doing as I please, so the pressure of intense, fast-paced learning 
for weeks on end is not something I am currently acclimatised to. I also accept that I am truly starting from an entry level of programming 
understanding, and so have a long hard way to the end of bootcamp and beyond I am sure. However I have always been interested in computing and 
some of the cultures around it, so I do not think I will struggle so much to come to terms with the processes along the way. I enjoy learning and 
the expansion that comes from linking different fields - synthesis! So for me the coding element is a vital piece of the modern day puzzle and I 
have no intention of backing away from it.
</p>

<h3><u>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </u></h3>

<p>Mainly I would like to develop a much better ability to interact and co-operate with team mates. In some ways I live quite an introverted life and 
at times get a bit stuck in my bubble. It is easy to stay home and read books and online articles and watch videos and all that… but working alongside 
people of diverse backgrounds and being able to communicate in a pleasant manner is a pivotal step for me now. I can already tell that there are many 
different people here on course with all different backgrounds, abilities and experiences. It is important to me to learn how to get to know others 
well, open up a bit more and hopefully create some friendships and professional connections. So, being ready to let the others in and not just be 
thinking of myself all the time. This is something I would like to continue developing.
</p>

<h3><u>Commitment to workload.</u></h3>>

<p>I have started to set myself toward a consistent time of work, something like the schedule that is upcoming with bootcamp. An 830am start is a 
possibility, ~12pm lunch, and working onwards until late afternoon with extra time most evenings & weekends available also.
<br>
Key to my success will be making time for planning. Half-an-hour to an hour on a Monday morning would be a good time to plan the sprint ahead and 
have a look at what might be coming up, ready to deal with things and ensure that the coast is clear to move ahead. From here I can stick to 
Timeboxing and continue to make use of toggl track.
<br>
Things I am aware of that I need to work around: I expect to have to pick up my kids from the school bus some days at 3pm. I believe currently it 
is Tuesday and Thursday when my partner is unavailable to get them. If required I can involve my mother-in-law also, who is willing to support with this. I need to finalise this and make a routine asap.
<Br>
My children have extracurricular activities that I will work around as far as dropping them off.
Circus - 4PM Tuesday.    Horse riding - 4pm Thursday.
Also a young mentee who I would like to continue meeting once a month on weekend for ~2hrs.
<Br>
Other things I would like to block out time for include weekly meetings I have at 8am-9.15am and 7.30pm-8.45pm on a Wednesday.
And also 12pm on some Tuesdays for 1 hour. 
<Br>
I also ensure that I exercise every single day, and generally take atleast one walk a day with attention off of work for this time.
<Br>
When things are getting to me I do have a variety of tools I can use for perspective and to free up my attention. I would prefer to work with a 
preventative approach so that things do not get too far out of hand. Breaking things down and taking them on one by one should help with this, and 
remaining focussed on the task at hand with minimal distractions. I will review this approach as time goes and do my best to keep relaxed along the way.
<Br>
I understand sometimes I will need help and will not hesitate to reach out to Lani or some of the crew in the Slack channel. This is no problem for me. 
If I have spent a couple of hours focussed on task and can’t see a way forward it is time to seek a new perspective from others.
<Br>
What I expect from facilitators might just be any helpful and honest feedback of what is going to plan and what needs extra attention, what is helpful 
and what is unnecessary. Possibly areas that I have blind spots. I’m open to this learning if it will help in the long run and assists the bigger picture.
<br>
Thank you.
