        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
Long, long term I would love to work with a company doing software development on something big and intertwined with human
consciousness on a global level… whether it is something in a metaverse-type realm, or Neuralink. Blockchain, or spaceships haha. I don’t know but something big, juicy and interesting.
On the way to this I would love to start as a junior developer and learn the ropes with a beautiful company somewhere in New Zealand. I don’t mind too much what work this would be other than that it is a positive contribution to society and there is an aligned team enjoying working together on the project. 


A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning

Some strengths include vision. I am quite fond of deep contemplation about what is going on in my own life and in the wider world, and as a result I feel that my interest in the learning journey is quite multidimensional. I know how far the ripples spread and that we are capable of great things as a society if we all work together. What we choose to place our attention on and how we proceed really does make a difference, and that means I will continue to hold high standards, take on challenges and dream big. I do not take life for granted. I think my commitment to bigger picture values could be a strength as it prevents me from giving up.

Limitations - My time management is not exactly marvellous, and will definitely need improvement. I am coming out of several years of my life where I have worked part-time and spent the rest of my time hanging out and doing as I please, so the pressure of intense, fast-paced learning for weeks on end is not something I am currently acclimatised to. I also accept that I am truly starting from an entry level of programming understanding, and so have a long hard way to the end of bootcamp and beyond I am sure. However I have always been interested in computing and some of the cultures around it, so I do not think I will struggle so much to come to terms with the processes along the way. I enjoy learning and the expansion that comes from linking different fields - synthesis! So for me the coding element is a vital piece of the modern day puzzle and I have no intention of backing away from it.


What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 

Mainly I would like to develop a much better ability to interact and co-operate with team mates. I think in some ways I live quite a hermetic life and maybe get a bit stuck in my bubble. It is easy to stay home and read books and online articles and watch videos and all that… but interacting with people of diverse backgrounds and being able to communicate in a pleasant manner is a pivotal step for me now. I can already tell that there are many different people here on course with all different backgrounds, abilities and experiences. It is important to me to learn how to get to know others well, open up a bit more and hopefully create some friendships and professional connections. So, being ready to let the others in and not just be thinking of myself all the time. That is something I would like to see.
A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.

I must start to set myself toward a consistent time of work, something like the schedule that is to come with bootcamp. An 830am start is a possibility, ~12pm lunch, and working onwards until late afternoon with time most evenings & weekends available also.

Key to my success will be making time for planning. Half an hour or so on a Monday morning would be a good time to plan the sprint ahead and have a look at what might be coming up, ready to deal with things and ensure that the coast is clear to move ahead. From here I can stick to Timeboxing and continue to make use of toggl track.

Things I am aware of that I need to work around: I expect to have to pick up my kids from the school bus some days at 3pm and will have to figure out exactly which days this is, with my partner. I believe currently it is Tuesday and Thursday when she works at that time.. If required I can involve my mother-in-law also, who is willing to support with this. I need to finalise this and make a routine asap.

My children have extracurricular activities that I need to ensure are at appropriate times for someone else to take them.
Circus - 4PM Tuesday.    Horse riding - 4pm Thursday.
Also a young mentee who I would like to continue meeting once a month on weekend for ~2hrs.

Other things I would like to block out time for include weekly meetings I have at 8am-9.15am and 7.30pm-8.45pm on a Wednesday. And also 12pm on some Tuesdays for 1 hour. 

I also ensure that I exercise every single day, and generally take atleast one walk a day with attention off of work for this time.

When things are getting to me I do have a variety of tools I can use for perspective and to free up my attention. I would prefer to work with a preventative approach so that things do not get too far out of hand. Breaking things down and taking them on one by one should help with this, and remaining focussed on the task at hand with minimal distractions. I will review this approach as time goes and do my best to keep relaxed along the way.

I understand sometimes I will need help and will not hesitate to reach out to Lani or some of the crew in the Slack channel. This is no problem for me. If I have spent a couple of hours on task and can’t see a way forward it is time to seek a new perspective from others.

What I expect from facilitators might be any helpful and honest feedback of what is going to plan and what is a bit off track, what is helpful and what is unnecessary. Possibly areas that I have blind spots. I’m open to this learning if it will help in the long run and assists the bigger picture.
